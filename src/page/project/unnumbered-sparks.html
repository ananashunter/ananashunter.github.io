        Unnumbered Sparks was a colossal interactive aerial sculpture created by
        <a href="http://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/" target="_blank">Google Data Arts Team</a> and
        <a href="http://www.echelman.com/" target="_blank">Studio Echelman</a> for the TED 2014 Conference in Vancouver, BC.

      <p>
        The sculpture was installed between Fairmont Waterfront and the Vancouver Convention Center and lit by 5 extremely powerful projectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team at Google developed a website with interactive WebGL graphics that can be controlled by anyone in the vicinity of the sculpture using only a smartphone and a web browser.
        In addition, we created local network infrastructure that could support interactions of several hundred users simultaneously using WebSocket protocol.
