        This is an ongoing and unfinished project that I wish to give more attention in the future.
        It is essentially a GPS data visualization application that takes advantage of GPU and shaders to provide extremely fast and interactive filtering of massive GPS datasets.

        You can <a href="http://akirodic.com/p/daily-routines/" target="_blank">see the last running version of the visualization here</a>. However, the data has not been updated in years.
